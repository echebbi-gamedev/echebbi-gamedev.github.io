I'm Emmanuel Chebbi, a back-end developer currently working on ways to build and support modular Domain-Specific Languages as a PhD Student at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en). 

I've always been thrilled by game development and want to focus on it during my spare time; I started this blog as a way to keep motivated and share my experiments. 

You'll find here reports of my progresses and short tutorials about features I find cool.
